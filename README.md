###### What is the question I hope to answer?
Hoping to discover some general neighborhood trends for various attributes of the data. Would also like to predict the price of a listing based on the other various factors in this dataset. 

###### What data am I using?
I'll be using this Kaggle data set that contains Airbnb data for New York City for 2019

###### What do I know about the data so far?
There are ~48,000 records in this data set with 16 attributes per record.

###### Why did I choose this data set?
This data was super relateable to me - as someone who both lived in New York and also frequently uses the service.
